Risk Assessment

I was tasked with creating a web application using Spring Boot framework with Java programming language. The application was connected to a local database and an in-memory SQL database. MYSQL was used as the local database via the workbench application on the desktop. 
During the application, I encountered many issues. Had problems with connecting to the database, Swagger was not displaying the end points for the application and still does not. 
More Unit testing could have been done on the project. There are some tests within the project, but they are not passing. Time is now constraint as the tests would need to be written again or corrected given some more time.   
Still having problems testing with selenium which I spent a considerable time on trying to test but to no avail. 
The project has been very frustrating to undertake. Have had to use mostly external resources to get where I got. Testing is an area that needs to be developed. And I would politely even at this late stage request a few days to understand how tests are meant to be written in the context of a spring application. 

The many resources out there are very outdated and end up breaking the application. QA resources are not sufficient when it comes to this area. 

Things to do more of; 

Complete testing of all controllers and services of the application. I feel like guidance would be required on my part to understand fully especially in the context of a spring application 

Use of tools such as selenium and swagger feel like some more guidance would be appreciated. 

Complete the third entity to have full crud implementation. Can currently create an employee class but time was a constraint I had to investigate testing as well. Given time can successfully complete the entity like the others  

Have leant how to create applications using spring boot and very comfortable with Java that I would go out and create my own app. But please I need help on testing.
